# State of Cobalt

This is a working draft of a research project, more info to follow :)

Technical TODOs:

1. Set up react + react-router
2. Create pages:
   1. Program Pitch (fullpage vertical scroll-snapped info site)
   2. State of Cobalt - 2021 (in-depth research report)
3. Create GitHub organization
   1. Get Josh/Sarah on org
   2. Find appropriate home for pitch deck vs research

## Local Setup

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm i
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
