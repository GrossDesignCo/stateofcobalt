Some companies are already investing in cobalt alternatives, but those efforts aren’t likely to outweigh the increase in global demand.</p><p>Cobalt is predominantly used in lithium-ion batteries, or rechargeable batteries that hold a higher charge due to the chemical structure of cobalt allowing larger amounts of energy to be stored in a smaller space (energy density) and degrading less over time &amp; energy transferred (longer shelf-life) than nearly every alternative. These are at the heart of modern technologies, from phones to the electric vehicles.</p><p>Even large-scale green infrastructure projects that are essential for sustainable energy require massive, utility-scale batteries like the Tesla Megapack currently require cobalt, although alternative materials look promising in this field. Stationary batteries don’t have the same energy-density requirements as vehicles or consumer electronics, meaning that they can take advantage of relatively cheaper (but heavier &amp; larger) materials.</p><p>Cobalt’s high energy density and low degradation means higher potential for its applications, because it can go longer, be smaller, and weigh less, than alternatives like Iron, Nickel, or Manganese. Cobalt itself is also highly resistant to high heat and wear over time, making it a prime choice for jet engines.</p><h2><a href="#applications" class="permalink" aria-label="Copy permalink"><svg viewBox="0 0 21 21" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="icon icon-link"><path fill="none" fill-rule="evenodd" stroke="currentColor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" d="M9.5 7.5l1-1a2.828 2.828 0 114 4l-1 1m-2 2l-2 2a2.828 2.828 0 11-4-4l2-2M7.5 13.5l5-5"></path></svg></a>Applications</h2><p>The below represents a brief overview of the applications &amp; fields cobalt supports.</p><h3><a href="#energy" class="permalink" aria-label="Copy permalink"><svg viewBox="0 0 21 21" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="icon icon-link"><path fill="none" fill-rule="evenodd" stroke="currentColor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" d="M9.5 7.5l1-1a2.828 2.828 0 114 4l-1 1m-2 2l-2 2a2.828 2.828 0 11-4-4l2-2M7.5 13.5l5-5"></path></svg></a>Energy</h3><ul><li>Large-scale Lithium-ion batteries (electric vehicles, green infrastructure)</li><li>Consumer electronics (phones, laptops, etc.)</li><li>Solar panels and other photovoltaic cells</li><li>Clean fuel technologies (the catalytic properties of cobalt allow it to desulphurize hydrocarbons, producing cleaner fuel.)</li><li>Removal of nitrous oxide, mitigating greenhouse gasses.</li></ul><h3><a href="#manufacturing-industry" class="permalink" aria-label="Copy permalink"><svg viewBox="0 0 21 21" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="icon icon-link"><path fill="none" fill-rule="evenodd" stroke="currentColor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" d="M9.5 7.5l1-1a2.828 2.828 0 114 4l-1 1m-2 2l-2 2a2.828 2.828 0 11-4-4l2-2M7.5 13.5l5-5"></path></svg></a>Manufacturing &amp; Industry</h3><ul><li>Creates effective tools for cutting hard materials (ie.

Simply put, there isn’t any currently. Corporations, refineries, and countries are not required to disclose where their cobalt comes from. This is not helped by countries like China, who don’t enforce any current legislation regarding the matter. The current system provides very little insight into cobalt sourcing, and quite frankly responsible sourcing is not high on anyone’s agenda.</p><p>Internally, our organization is developing a program to explore the pursuit of legislation that supports supply chain transparency and the disclosure of cobalt sourcing for companies operating in the industry. Our goal is to find out the best ways in which a policy could be passed with the future goals being to eliminate:</p><ol><li>child mining</li><li>unsafe working conditions</li><li>inadequate compensation for artisanal and small-scale miners.</li></ol><p>There is legislation around the world that regulates the sourcing and mining or certain materials, but cobalt is left off the list.</p><h3><a href="#current-legislation" class="permalink" aria-label="Copy permalink"><svg viewBox="0 0 21 21" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="icon icon-link"><path fill="none" fill-rule="evenodd" stroke="currentColor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" d="M9.5 7.5l1-1a2.828 2.828 0 114 4l-1 1m-2 2l-2 2a2.828 2.828 0 11-4-4l2-2M7.5 13.5l5-5"></path></svg></a>Current Legislation</h3><ul><li>European Union - Regulation 2017/821</li><li>OECD - Due Diligence Guidance for Responsible Supply CHains of Minerals from Conflict-Affected and High Risk Areas</li><li>United States - Dodd Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, Section 1502</li><li>International Tin Association - Member-based organization that enforces a responsible sourcing “code of conduct”</li><li>Responsible Minerals Initiative / RMAP - member-based organization that enforces and regulate responsible sourcing practices and audits refiners and smelters</li></ul><p>In the European Union, in regulation 2017/821, article 1, it creates a Union system to support supply chain “due diligence,” regarding the sourcing and use of tin, tantalum, tungsten and gold, or any ores or materials containing such materials, as a means for armed militias and security forces to trade and perpetuate conflict as a result.</p><p>The Organization for Economic Development and Cooperation also has their own<em>Due Diligence Guidance for Responsible Supply Chains of Minerals from Conflict-Affected and High-Risk Areas</em>, that provides business guidance on how to ethically and sustainably source the 3Ts and gold without promoting unethical practices or conflict in areas already at high risk for instability and violence. Since 2016, their documentation provides guidelines for sourcing minerals, as well as business plans for how to create internal systems that support this idea of due diligence.</p><p>In the United States in 2010, Congress passed and amendment to section 13 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. In the “Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act,” section 1502, subsection b discusses the disclosure of minerals originating from the DRC, and require businesses to disclose their due diligence measures in a report audited by an independent body in the private sector, within 270 days or sourcing. The goal with this amendment was to curb the indirect financial support to armed groups who are enacting “extreme levels of violence… particularly sexual and gender-based violence, and contributing to an emergency humanitarian situation therein.”</p><p>Independent organizations that are working on this problem include PACT, and the International Tin Association (ITA). The ITA is a UK based organization that promotes the Tin industry and its use, but it also has a “Code of Conduct” for its members which requires them to be constantly innovating and evolving to be more sustainable, and more ethical in their sourcing of tin, and the workers and processes they employ. PACT implements their supply chain initiative, which promotes the traceability for tungsten, tantalum, and of course, tin.<!-- --> </p><h3><a href="#bare-minimum" class="permalink" aria-label="Copy permalink"><svg viewBox="0 0 21 21" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="icon icon-link"><path fill="none" fill-rule="evenodd" stroke="currentColor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" d="M9.5 7.5l1-1a2.828 2.828 0 114 4l-1 1m-2 2l-2 2a2.828 2.828 0 11-4-4l2-2M7.5 13.5l5-5"></path></svg></a>Bare Minimum</h3><p>These laws and organizations are setting a precedent for supply chain due diligence, but given the complexity of the supply chain, the intersection between public and private sector legislation, and volatile international relations and power dynamics, it becomes very difficult to bring companies who profit off of cobalt on board with regulating their supply chains. While companies like Apple and Tesla have committed to finding alternatives or investigating their supply chains, there isn’t a way to hold them accountable to supply chain transparency regarding cobalt sourcing, and this is putting lives at risk every day.</p><p>The current legislation presents a problem because it only accounts for the bare minimum. It provides for systems and groups to investigate and find ways to better source these minerals, but there is no accountability, and no guarantee that due diligence is actually happening. Even if there was, consumers aren’t aware of what exactly goes into their products, and subsequently can’t demand change. We need to go further with legislation, and require that our products are not unintentionally putting people at risk, just so we can claim to be moving in the right direction environmentally speaking.</p><p>As it stand right now, our organization is in conversation and building relationships with local legislators here in Washington state to understand the legislative systems closest to us, and to find the best route for implementing transparency, that not only accomplishes our three goals, but also raises awareness to consumers of the reality that our products put men, women and children at risk of injury, extreme poverty and death.</p><hgroup><h2><a href="#organizations-on-the-ground" class="permalink" aria-label="Copy permalink"><svg viewBox="0 0 21 21" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="icon icon-link"><path fill="none" fill-rule="evenodd" stroke="currentColor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" d="M9.5 7.5l1-1a2.828 2.828 0 114 4l-1 1m-2 2l-2 2a2.828 2.828 0 11-4-4l2-2M7.5 13.5l5-5"></path></svg></a>Organizations on the Ground</h2><p>Support</p></hgroup><p>True impact takes time, time that many individuals won’t have. As the DRC is home to the largest number of displaced persons, and the second largest number of food insecure people, there needs to be an effort made to mitigate poverty, food insecurity, gender-based discrimination, and many other human rights abuses. While our long term goals are still being realized, there are other ways in which we can help people now. This is a list of organizations who work in the DRC, and are either funded by countries in the global North, or by local, private and public partners. They approach development from a standpoint of localization: the use of local organizations to implement development. While supporting some of these organizations is only a short term solution, it is still crucial to the mitigation of poverty until larger changes can be made.</p><h3><a href="#pact" class="permalink" aria-label="Copy permalink"><svg viewBox="0 0 21 21" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" class="icon icon-link"><path fill="none" fill-rule="evenodd" stroke="currentColor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" d="M9.5 7.5l1-1a2.828 2.828 0 114 4l-1 1m-2 2l-2 2a2.828 2.828 0 11-4-4l2-2M7.5 13.5l5-5"></path></svg></a>PACT</h3><p>PACT is a nonprofit organization that performs international development in 40 different countries.
